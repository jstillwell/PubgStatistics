# PubgStatistics
Statistics overlay for PLAYERUNKNOWN'S Battlegrounds

1. You will need to create an account with https://pubgtracker.com/site-api and generate and API key. 
2. Next, add an environment variable for your API Key called PubgApiKey. 
3. Then replace your username in the stats.js file in the .Web project.

I wanted to keep this super simple so I just did an interval of 5 seconds to poll the API and used jQuery CDN.

Edit the css file to get a style you like.
